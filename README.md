# Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)

This project is focused on classifying brain tumors from MRI images. The dataset used is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri).

## Project Overview

Brain tumors are abnormal growths or masses of cells in the brain. They can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). This project aims to classify different types of brain tumors based on MRI scans, with the following categories:

- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**

## Methodology

The project uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the MRI images into one of the three tumor types. The model is fine-tuned on the provided dataset to achieve better performance.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the classification model:

1. Ensure that your dataset is in the correct folder as per the configuration.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook brain-tumar-classification-cnn-pretrained-model.ipynb
   ```
